# ForwardLikelihood

This is a python package for peculiar velocity analysis using forward likelihood method. Using this package, you can compare the peculiar velocities of a general peculiar velocity catalog to the reconstructed velocity from a galaxy catalog. Currently, one can use the following data for the peculiar velocity analysis:
- Direct distance estimates (with or without adding a intrinsic scatter and a rescaling factor)
- Forward Tully-Fisher relation (with the magnitude and the velocity width)
- Supernovae with SALT2 parameterization (With m, c and x_1)
